# Rust Web Server Implementation

## Reflections

1. Reflection from the first step is that we can implement single threaded web server only with rust
   - Rust's ownership system and type safety make it surprisingly straightforward to build a basic web server
   - The standard library provides all necessary tools (TcpListener, TcpStream) for network programming
   - Single-threaded implementation is simple but has limitations:
     * Can only handle one request at a time
     * Subsequent requests must wait for the current one to complete
     * Not suitable for production use with multiple concurrent users
   - This implementation serves as a great learning exercise for understanding:
     * Basic TCP networking concepts
     * HTTP protocol fundamentals
     * Rust's error handling patterns
     * File I/O operations

2. Reflection from the first step is that we can also implement http web server with rust
   - Rust's performance characteristics make it an excellent choice for web servers
   - The implementation demonstrates:
     * How to parse HTTP requests using Rust's iterator methods
     * Proper HTTP response formatting with status codes and headers
     * File serving capabilities through the standard library
     * Error handling using Rust's Result type
   - The code shows Rust's ability to handle:
     * Network I/O operations
     * String manipulation for HTTP headers
     * File system operations
     * Memory safety without garbage collection
